            My name is Gavin Rilee, <br>
            </br>I am a Full Stack Web Devolper learning at Lambda School.
            I love to watch anime, hiking, surfing, biking, MOVIES, playing soccer and paintball.<br></br>
            I found passion in coding when the pandemic broke out and all the things you can build with it!
